            <p class="mb-6">Dearest Denise,</p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                I'm writing this letter under the pretense of doing research, HAHAHAHAH. I'm not sure if you'll believe me, but I hope so! So, what did you think of my little surprise in the PPT? Did you enjoy it? I really hope you did, but if not, that's okay, haha.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Now, back to business. I'm writing to wish you a Happy Monthsary! It's crazy to think that we've been bickering, teasing, loving, and laughing together for five months. It's hard to believe how fast time has flown. I'm still processing the idea that I have someone like you in my life, so please bear with me if I seem distant sometimes. I promise I'm trying my very best to be a good partner for you. If I ever fall short, please just tell me. I am all ears. What don't you like about my actions? I'll try to change, though I can't promise it will happen immediately. But I am willing to change, as long as it's for you.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
                These past five months have felt like a roller coaster. There have been happy days and days filled with arguments and tears, but we've always made it through. We have each other. I know we're going somewhere on this journey because we never leave each other behind. And if a day comes when one of us gets left behind, I hope we never choose to continue without the other, because I swear to God, I can't handle it. It might sound dramatic, but I'm serious. I can't imagine a morning where you aren't here. So, no matter what, I hope we keep choosing each other. I am ready to give and give for you because you are worthy of it. Even if you say you aren't, I already promised that to the Lord a long time ago. BLEEEEEEEEEEHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAH.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8">
                I love you, baby! I have so much more I want to say, but the words are jumbling in my head. When it comes to you, I always seem to run out of words—but in a good way. It's just that for me, there are no exact words to describe how happy I am to have you in my life or how much I love you. Or maybe it's just because you're so much better at writing letters… I love you, my baby, my bebu, my babu, my lalove, my boss madame, to infinity and beyond.
            </p>
            <p class="text-right mt-8">Yours truly,</p>
